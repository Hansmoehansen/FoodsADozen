FoodsADozen
===========

Welcome to the FoodsADozen GitHub!

To start off with, my name is Hans (Hansmoehansen) and I am the authot of FoodsADozen.

A you might see the project, in its current form is far from complete.
For example a lot of recipes and items.

Currently there are about 10 items in the mod but this will hopefully increase rapidly over the next couple of weeks.

My first aim was to release the "Bakery Update" (1.7.10-1.0) by the end of August however I have pushed it back to the middle of September because of school.

Thanks for reading
-Hans
